			<b>History about Child Soldiers</b>
			<p>People started to use child soldiers back in 1212 by medieval Europe under the assumption that divine power would enable them to conquer their enemies. Although these children did not see combat the majority of them were sold into slavery. After that the next major use of child soldiers was back in 1814 when Napoleon was faced with invasion by a massive Allied force. After that, there were countless uses of child soldiers. The next major use of child soldiers was in WW1 and WW2 by Germany where they were often sent to the front lines with little to no training. Nowadays, there could possibly more than 100,000 child soldiers in around 18 countries.</p>
