				<p><b><h2><u>Question 1: What have the Popes had to say on the topic?</b></p></h2></u>
				<p>There were many Popes that were in support of ending Child Soldiers. Two of the peoples were Pope Francis when he released his 12th edition of challenges facing humanity where he pleaded for the World to end Child Soldiers. Another Pope is Pope Benedict XVI where he fully supported the UN Campaigns to end child soldiers and that he prays each day for those children.</p>
				<p><b><h2><u>Question 2: Provide thoughts from two other Catholic sources or scholars on the issue?</b></p></h2></u>
				<p>There were many sources from the Catholic Church about Child Soldiers. Some of the people accounts are the Popes and the Vatican and how they fully support the UN plans to end Child Soldiers and how they have made their site about what issues Children face when being soldiers.</p>
				<p>Information thanks to: <a target=blank href="https://www.ncronline.org/news/vatican/pope-supports-un-campaign-end-use-child-soldiers">ncronline</a> and <a target=blank href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/migrants/pom99-00_81_84/rc_pc_migrants_pom81_blume.htm">Vatican</a>.</p>
				<p><b><h2><u>Question 3: Which Catholic Social Justice Teaching (s)is/are related to this issue? Explain how it/they is/are related?</b></p></h2></u>
				<p>One of the Catholic Social Justice Teaching about Child Soldiers is Human Dignity. One of the organisations showing this teaching is War Child as they try to save as many child soldiers as they can.</p>
				<p><b><h2><u>Question 4: What did Jesus want us to do about this issue and why?</b></p></h2></u>
