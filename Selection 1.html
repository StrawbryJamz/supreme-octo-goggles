			<p><b><h2><u>Question 3: What are the major ways this issue is being addressed, give at least 3 specific examples with a detailed explanation for each?</b></p></h2></u>
			<ol>
				<p>1. A way that this issue is trying to be addressed is during 1949 by the Geneva Conventions which states that all parties in a conflict shall take “all feasible measures” to ensure that children under the age of 15 do not direct action in a war.</p>
				<p>2. Many countries like Australia, Germany, Belgium and many other countries have introduced a law that states that recruiting or using children under 15 years old, criminally liable.</p>
				<p>3. The country that has done the most consideration with the issue is the United States they have not only had laws but have also made it that such people are ineligible for immigration status, and they cannot seek asylum. The United States has also passed an act that prevents military aid to countries that exploit children. With the only way, aid can be provided to those countries is if the president overrides this on a basis of national interest.</p>
				<p>4. The United Nations have also addressed the issue with many ‘Actions Plans’ which outline a list of steps that have been taken to stop child soldiers. The rules that these action plans enforce are they criminalize the recruitment and the use of child soldiers, they issue a military to stop recruitment, appointing child protection specialist in security forces and strengthening birth registration and integrating age-verification mechanisms in the recruitment process.</p>

			<p><b><h2><u>Question 4: Provide thoughts from two Secular sources or scholars on the issue?</b></p></h2></u>
			<p><b>The United Nations View on Child Soldiers</b></p>
			<p>Margot Wallström , Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden and Leila Zerrougui , Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict says that:</p>
			<p>“When kids  close their eyes, they do not replay the happy and innocent memories of their day, but instead fight to keep from their minds the horrors they have seen that day. There is no loving parent to tuck them in; indeed, many shudder at the sound of footsteps approaching their bed. This is the experience of child soldiers around the world.Since 2000, over 115,000 children have been released from armed forces and groups. This shows the power of the UN and member states working together to give back a future to those who thought they had been abandoned.” “No child should ever have to pick up a weapon and fight” said Mahimbo Mdoe, the head of UNICEF programmes in the country."</p>

			<p>CNN's View on Child Soldiers:</p>
			<p>Cnn Believes that Child soldiers should be helped and reintegrated into a normal and good life. They say here that: “There is, though, an oft-overlooked point that also highlights one of the difficulties we face if we are going to tackle the problem of child soldiers.” and “Hence, they act in different ways once they are in these armed groups. Some children are abducted, drugged, brainwashed and brutalized. Many refuse to kill, some kill to survive, others murder to thrive.” Cnn wants to help reintegrate child soldiers that have suffered from their time in the war. They want them to get medical help and a normal life.</p>
